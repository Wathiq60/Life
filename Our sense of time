## Where to live

You live now. Yes there are times when you think about the future and about the past, but even while you are thinking of the future or the past, you are thinking about them in the present moment. So you might not be able to travel in time, but you can surely see in time.

Think of a tree, it cannot move, it is fixed in one place. You are greater than a tree; you can move around the Earth. Think of an animal, it too can move around. You are greater than an animal because you cannot only move around in physical space but also in time. I don't mean time travel, since we are all bound by time and can only live *now*; but i mean we can see the past and the future. Thus our ability to travel in time is our defining feature.
